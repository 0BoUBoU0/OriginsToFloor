It's a simple tool will move the origin of each selected mesh to its lower part.

It has 3 ways to use it :

1. origins on the floor : the origin of each selected mesh goes to its lower part
2. origins centered on the floor :  the origin of each selected mesh goes to the center of X and Y axis, but goes to its lower part on the Z axis
3. use the smoothed version of the model : the origin will be on th lower Z-Axis part of the mesh, regarding of the smoothed version of the mesh

But, why ?
Sure, we can do it easily by hand, but this addon can do it in one click on multiple objects ! And it's always a time saver for multiple furnitures !
